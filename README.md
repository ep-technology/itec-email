ITEC Email templates
====================

These are the DG ITEC email templates.

DG ITEC is the Directorate General for Innovation and Technology at the European Parliament.

About the templates
==

These email templates follow the responsive mobile-first design that we like to apply to all our content. 

Use them and stick to them, and your message will look great on all platforms.

If you don't take care of the underlying code, like when you edit them with Word or Outlook, things will break. 

When they do, emails look bad, and we feel bad. So please don't. Instead, talk to the ITEC communication service.

Available templates
==

Different scenarios require different email templates. Here's what's included:

**robot.txt**

Not as much a template as a statement: If you have an application sending out automated messages, consider sending them in plain text.

Automated messages typically often get filtered or processed by robots. Robots love plain text, so embrace it where it's suitable.

**announcement.html**

This is the email template that is most popular. It's a simple message, with a title, body copy and a footer to provide some extra information on the sender.

**call-to-action.html**

A specific template for a call-to-action email. It comes with an image, title and short description, all aimed at inviting readers to click the button that wraps it up.

**modular.html**

The modular template bundles a number of design elements that you can combine to build your specific template. It has one-column and two-column layout, and a list of articles that you might like for linking to online post
